1. (match '?x 1 nil) returns the following:
((?X . 1))
T

2. Why does the match function return two values?
The first return is a list of associated lists that show each match found. The
second return is a flag T or nil, indicating whether or not the match was
successful.

3. Give an example for the kind of structure that would satisfy var.
?adam_minter

4. Give an example for the kind of structure that would not satisfy var.
adam_minter

5. Why does binding call itself recursively before it looks at the cdr of the
current binding? 
This function has to be recursive, becasue matching can build up binding lists
in which a variable is only indirectly associated with it's value: ?x might be
bound to an in virtue of the list containing both (?x . ?y) and (?y . a).

6. The function data1 includes a predicate 'sameSex' that matches to two
persons. Except for gender, every other field has a suffix that is either
'1' or '2'. Does gender need a suffix? Why or why not?
Gender can only have 2 different values, male or female. There isn't any other
option, so there doesn't need to be any extra organization to the rule.
